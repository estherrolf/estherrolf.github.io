									<p>If you are interested in a <strong>research position (at any level)</strong> in the lab, please first familiarize yourself with our recent research (e.g. through google scholar) and the goals of our lab (which you can find on my website).</p>

									<p>If you are a <strong>current CU Master's or PhD student</strong>, taking my research topics class (CSCI 7000: Current Topics in Computer Science: Geospatial & Statistical Machine Learning) is a great way to get a hands-on introduction to my research field.</p>

									<p>If you are interested in being a <strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong> in the lab, please email me directly*, and include (i) the goals for your postdoc, (ii) some specific project ideas or areas you'd like to work on, and (iii) a summary of your research experience and how it aligns with and/or extends the strengths of my lab. Please note that at this time, I am primarily looking for postdocs who have a demonstrated record of machine learning research (e.g., through publications in machine learning venues). </p>

									<p>If you are applying to be a <strong>PhD student</strong> in the lab, you must apply to the CS PhD program at CU Boulder (instructions and resources for applying can be found at the department page) and list me as a potential advisor in the application form. In your application, please make it clear how your research interests align with the broader goals of the lab, and describe how your previous experiences will help you achieve your research goals for your PhD. To guide you in this process, please see the following links for resources:
									<li><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/graduate-admissions"> CU Boulder's CS graduate admissions homepage </a></li>
									<li>CU Boulder CS program's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/graduate-admissions/how-apply"> tips for creating an impactful application and opportunities for an application fee waiver.</a></li>
									<li>In Fall 2024, will host a "pre-advising" session on zoom for potential applicants in the (stay tuned for the date and how to register).</li>
									</p>	

									<p>If you are interested in getting involved in a different way from any of the above, please email me* with a brief description of yourself and your interest in the lab, and we can take it from there. </p>

									<p>*Please note that I am not able to respond to all email inquiries. Following the guidelines on this page is the best way to increase your chance of a response. </p>
